### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in a group project on clustering of client reviews by topic with NLP in partnership with lesFurets.com.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science in my 5th year of school at ESILV and I am particularly interested in Deep learning and Computer vision.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a 6 months end-of-study internship from February 2023 where I could deepen my knowledge in these fields.
